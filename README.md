* For client, in this project, client can utilize one coffee card to enjoy different benefits from various coffee shops. For example, the coffee card can have extra discounts on over 100 coffee shops. The most important thing is that cient will not worry about the coffee shop's bankrupt, they pay the fee for coffee card, recharge the token for coffee card and the coffee card only belongs to client. It is easy to indicated that all benefits and token will only in the coffee card, not the coffee shop.
* For Merchant, as the coffee shop owern, they can develop own coffee card (NFT) and sell them on the platform or other marketplaces. The coffee shop can distribute the discount, gift via coffee card. it is really easy to reach their customers and don't need to develop own App or platform.
